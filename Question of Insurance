Our Insurance is due quite soon.
It is split in two.  The first is the General Liability, for $830.  The second is Liability for the Board, for $808.  This last was a provision because our original board had lawyers on the team, and they felt it was an absolute priority.  
But do you?
We could save $808 if we cancel that insurance for the board.
Please consider:  We're about to embark on our most controversial show:  The Cannibal Diaries, by Paco Jose Madden.  If anyone was going to get sue-happy over content, I anticipate this would be the show.  My understanding is it is relatively rare for such a suit, especially in Regional/Community Theater.  
Please add to this document and list your name below your comment so we know how folx feel.

Thank you all!
